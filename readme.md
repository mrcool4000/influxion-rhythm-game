### What Is Influxion?
To fit with the theme of the music jam (music if that wasn't obvious), we built Influxion because we guessed that many of the other submissions would be music players, music builders, et cetera. We wanted our project to be different but fun to play/use nevertheless. Influxion is a level-based rhythm game that combines platformers and reaction-based games.
